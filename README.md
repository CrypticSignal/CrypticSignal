### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught Python and JavaScript programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

Programming gives me a feeling of satisfaction - making something that is useful, saves time or helps others. Also, there is always something to learn, whether it be a particular library or a new programming language, and that keeps things interesting.

The most recent thing I've learnt is the Redux library, and I have made use of Redux for my [av-converter](https://github.com/CrypticSignal/av-converter) website, which allows users to convert audio and video files to another format. It has a Python/Flask backend and React frontend.

ðŸ’¬ I can be contacted via Discord - Cryptic Signal#4416
