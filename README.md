### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught Python and JavaScript programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

I enjoy programming as it allows me to make something that is useful, saves time or helps others. Also, there is always something to learn, whether it be a particular library or a new programming language, and that keeps things interesting.

The most recent thing I've learnt is the Redux library, and I have made use of Redux for my [av-converter](https://github.com/CrypticSignal/av-converter) website, which allows users to convert audio and video files to another format. It has a Python/Flask backend and React frontend.

Audio is another interest of mine, and what you see in my profile picture is my SVS PB-1000 subwoofer. I'm using a pair of Monitor Audio RX2 speakers as my fronts with the crossover at 80 Hz. I would like to upgrade one day, possibly to a pair of JTR towers for my fronts and 15" (or larger) subwoofers.

ðŸ’¬ I can be contacted via Discord - Cryptic Signal#4416
