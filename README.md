### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught Python and JavaScript programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Audio and video are interests of mine. I play chess from time to time, using an open-source chess server called Lichess. I recently made use of the Redux library for my [av-converter](https://github.com/CrypticSignal/av-converter) project, which allows users to convert audio and video files to another format. It has a Python/Flask backend and React frontend. 

ðŸ’¬ I can be contacted via Discord - Cryptic Signal#4416
